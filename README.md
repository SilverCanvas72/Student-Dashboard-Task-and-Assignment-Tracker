### Why?
I made the project because I am obsessed with organisation and wanted to make the system I would genuinly use.

### How you made your project?
I used vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript to make the project aswell as making the mockups in Figma
The project is deployed using Vercel

### What you struggled with and what you learned
I learnt more about the positioning on a website using flexboxes in CSS aswell as saving user data to their local storage is JS which is something I had not done before.
